# Tabs

```sh
yarn add @freshworks/tabs
```

Tabs are used to organise content under each section. Tabs are most helpful when there is a lot of content to show in a page. Tabs can help in showing content which are under the same level of hierarchy, under each section inside the same page.

## Usage

#### 1. Categorisation

It's easy for the user to quickly distinguish which tab belongs to which content.

{{#docs-demo as |demo|}}
  {{#demo.example name="nucleus-tabs.hbs"}}
    {{nucleus-tabs}}
  {{/demo.example}}
  {{demo.snippet 'nucleus-tabs.hbs'}}
{{/docs-demo}}


## Guidelines

âœ…**Do's**

1. Tabs should be placed in a single row over the content

2. Include all interactive states for the tabs


ðŸš«**Dont's**

1. Dont use tabs for sequential content. Users can navigate to any tab at any time and cannot be expected to do it sequentially.
